# Malaria Diagnosis (Disease Modeling)
Repository for Malaria Diagnosis

## Introduction:
Malaria is a deadly disease that is caused by parasites that are transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. It is a major public health problem in many parts of the world.
No of Cases - 200 Million per year
Death count - 400,000 per year
Mostly Found in Africa and tropical countries.

### Diagnosis Methods

1. Traditional Method : Microscope Diagnosis - Malaria is diagnosed generally by microscopic examination of blood. However, this method 
   can be time-consuming and requires a trained technician.

2. Rapid Diagnostic Test - RDTs work by detecting the presence of malaria antigens in a blood sample.
   
3. Recently, as machine learning has enhanced, there has been a growing interest in automating diagnosis of malaria. One of the approaches to automated malaria diagnosis is using convolutional neural network (CNN) model. CNNs models are specially designed for image recognition. They have been effective at classifying malaria cells in images.
